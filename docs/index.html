            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's dynamic world, the study and application of swarm intelligence have become increasingly relevant across various fields, from optimization problems to robotics. 
                To facilitate experimentation and exploration within this domain, we have developed a discrete event simulation (DES) framework with a core designed to be technology-agnostic. 
                This framework prioritizes modularity, extensibility, and flexibility, enabling the seamless integration of diverse swarm intelligence strategies without necessitating alterations to the simulation core.</p>
            <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
            <p>The primary goal of this project was to create a simulation engine detached from specific swarm intelligence strategies.

            <h2>Architectural Design</h2>
            <p>The chosen architecture employs the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, which ensures flexibility, modularity, and most importantly, allows the creation of an agnostic core with a well-defined structure.
                To this end, an abstract structure has been developed to provide base classes for various swarms that extend them. By leveraging patterns such as the Template Method, code reuse is maximized, making the code structure much more concise.
                Through MVC, the separation of concerns is prioritized, ensuring flexibility and allowing modifications to portions of the code independently from others. The simulation is governed by the controller, which utilizes the logic implemented in the model.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Design</h2>

            <h3>Environment Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The system simulates a virtual environment where agents and objects interact within a defined grid. The <code>Grid</code> 
                trait acts as a blueprint for any grid-based environment. The design focuses on modularity, flexibility, and maintainability 
                to accommodate future enhancements and changes. The simulation occurs within the <code>Environment</code> class, which extends 
                the <code>Grid</code> trait. The environment is represented by a matrix of dimensions <code>height x width</code>, where cells 
                can contain agents and objects. Agents move and interact with objects based on specific logic. By leveraging design patterns 
                like the Template Method and principles such as composition over inheritance, the system can easily accommodate future 
                enhancements and changes.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>
                Since the <code>Environment</code> can easily become a god-class, having to deal with a lot of dynamics, the use of composition 
                is very useful. It enhances the separation of concerns principle by allowing independent component testing. It also favors 
                encapsulation, which hides the complexity of these operations from the <code>Environment</code> class, making it simpler and more 
                focused on high-level functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>Template method</h3>
            <p>
                As can be seen in the <code>Environment</code> class, the moveAgent method is based off 3 methods, <code>preMoveActions(agent: Agent)</code>, <code>postMoveActions(agent: Agent)</code> and <code>interactWithObject(agent: Agent)</code> 
                which are implemented by the extending classes. This allows for a more concise code structure and promotes code reuse.
